# How to Read from Kafka and Send to Graphana Livestreaming using web sockets

To read from Kafka and send data to Grafana using web sockets, you will need to use a tool or library that can connect to Kafka and Grafana and handle the communication between the two systems. Some examples of tools that can be used for this purpose are:

* Apache Camel: This is an open-source integration framework that can be used to connect to Kafka and Grafana and route data between the two systems using web sockets.
* Kafka Connect: This is a tool included with the Apache Kafka platform that can be used to connect Kafka to external systems, such as Grafana, and stream data between them.
* Kafka Streams: This is a Java library that can be used to process data in real-time streams from Kafka and send the processed data to other systems, such as Grafana, using web sockets.

Once you have chosen a tool or library to use, you will need to configure it to connect to Kafka and Grafana and handle the communication between the two systems. The exact steps for doing this will vary depending on the tool or library you are using, so you should refer to the documentation for the specific tool or library you are using for more detailed instructions.

# How to Read from Kafka and Send to Graphana Livestreaming using Kafka Streams

To read from Kafka and send to Grafana for live streaming using Kafka Streams, you will need to do the following:

* Set up a Kafka Streams application that reads data from the Kafka topic you want to stream to Grafana.
* Use the Kafka Streams API to process and transform the data as needed.
* Use the Grafana HTTP API to push the transformed data to a Grafana dashboard for live streaming.
Here is an example of how this could be done in Java using the Kafka Streams API and Grafana HTTP API:

```java
// Set up the Kafka Streams application
Properties streamsConfig = new Properties();
streamsConfig.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "grafana-streaming-app");
streamsConfig.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "kafka:9092");

// Create a Kafka Streams processor topology
Topology topology = new Topology();
topology.addSource("source", "input-topic");
topology.addProcessor("processor", () -> new GrafanaStreamProcessor(), "source");

// Set up the Kafka Streams application
KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, streamsConfig);

// Start the Kafka Streams application
streams.start();

// Push data to Grafana using the HTTP API
HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.createDefault();
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("http://grafana:3000/api/datasources/proxy/1/api/v1/write"))
    .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString("metric_name value=1"))
    .build();
httpClient.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
    .thenApply(HttpResponse::body)
    .thenAccept(System
```
