# General
The Modbus protocol is a widely-used industrial communications protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other over a serial network. It was originally developed by Modicon in 1979, and it is now used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications.

Modbus is a type of industrial communication protocol that is used to send data between industrial devices. It is based on a master-slave architecture, where the master device can send requests to and receive responses from slave devices on the network. The master device typically polls the slave devices to request data, and the slave devices respond with the requested information. The exact details of how Modbus works depend on the specific implementation, but the basic principles remain the same. In general, Modbus is a simple, easy-to-use protocol that is widely used in industrial automation and control systems.

* The Modbus protocol uses a request-response model, where the master device sends requests to the slave devices and the slave devices respond with the requested information. The master device can also send commands to the slave devices, which the slave devices can use to control their operation.
* Modbus uses a binary format for its messages, which means that the data is represented as a series of ones and zeros. Each message has a specific format that includes a header, a function code, and data. The function code specifies the type of request or response, and the data contains the actual information being exchanged.
* Modbus supports several different types of data, including binary, integer, and floating-point values. It also supports different data formats, such as big-endian and little-endian, which determine the order in which the bits are arranged in the message.
* Modbus uses a simple, straightforward communication model that makes it easy to implement and use. It is a widely-used protocol in industrial automation and control systems, and it is supported by many different types of devices and software.
* Modbus is an open protocol, which means that the specification is publicly available and anyone can implement it in their products. This has led to the widespread adoption of Modbus in a variety of different industries and applications.

# Example of usage

Modbus is a widely used communications protocol in the field of industrial automation and control. It is typically used for transmitting data between control systems, sensors, and actuators in a wide range of applications, including manufacturing, building automation, power generation and distribution, and water and wastewater management.

Here are a few examples of where the Modbus protocol might be used:

* In a manufacturing plant, Modbus could be used to communicate between the control system and the various sensors and actuators that are used to monitor and control the production process. For example, the control system might use Modbus to read the values of temperature, pressure, and flow sensors, and to control the speed and direction of motors, valves, and other equipment.
* In a building automation system, Modbus could be used to communicate between the control system and the various sensors and actuators that are used to monitor and control the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. For example, the control system might use Modbus to read the values of temperature, humidity, and air quality sensors, and to control the operation of fans, pumps, and other HVAC equipment.
* In a power generation and distribution system, Modbus could be used to communicate between the control system and the various sensors and actuators that are used to monitor and control the generation and distribution of electricity. For example, the control system might use Modbus to read the values of voltage, current, and power sensors, and to control the operation of generators, transformers, and other electrical equipment.
* In a water and wastewater management system, Modbus could be used to communicate between the control system and the various sensors and actuators that are used to monitor and control the treatment and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of wastewater. For example, the control system might use Modbus to read the values of pH, flow, and pressure sensors, and to control the operation of pumps, valves, and other equipment.


# Registers and coils

In the Modbus protocol, data is organized into registers and coils. Registers are used to store numerical values, such as temperatures, pressures, or other types of measured data. Coils are used to store binary values, such as on/off states or digital inputs and outputs.

* Registers are typically 16-bit words, which means that they can store integer values ranging from 0 to 65535. Some Modbus implementations also support 32-bit registers, which can store larger integer values or floating-point values.
* Coils are single-bit values, which means that they can only store a value of 0 or 1. Coils are often used to represent the state of digital inputs and outputs, such as the on/off state of a relay or the open/closed state of a valve.

Modbus registers and coils are addressed using a unique 16-bit number, which allows the master device to read or write specific values on the slave device. The exact meaning of each register and coil depends on the specific implementation, but the basic concept is the same across different Modbus systems.

# Variations
Modbus is a widely-used protocol in industrial automation and control systems, and it has evolved over time to support a variety of different applications and environments. As a result, there are several different variations of the Modbus protocol, each of which is designed for a specific purpose or use case. Some of the most common variations of Modbus include:

* Modbus RTU: This is the original version of the Modbus protocol, which uses a binary format for its messages and is designed for use over serial connections, such as RS-485 or RS-232.
* Modbus ASCII: This variation of the Modbus protocol uses an ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) representation for its messages, which makes it easier to read and debug. It is also designed for use over serial connections.
* Modbus TCP/IP: This variation of the Modbus protocol uses TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) as the underlying communication layer, which allows Modbus devices to be connected over Ethernet networks.
* Modbus Plus: This is a proprietary variation of the Modbus protocol that was developed by Schneider Electric. It uses a higher-speed communication layer and adds support for additional features, such as peer-to-peer communication and network management.
* Modbus/TCP: This variation of the Modbus protocol is similar to Modbus TCP/IP, but it uses a different message format and adds support for additional function codes. It is commonly used in systems that require high-speed communication and real-time performance.

These are just a few examples of the many variations of the Modbus protocol that are available. In general, the specific variation of Modbus that is used depends on the requirements of the application and the capabilities of the devices that are being used.


# Memory
In the Modbus protocol, data is organized into registers and coils, as I mentioned earlier. Each register and coil is addressed using a unique 16-bit number, which allows the master device to read or write specific values on the slave device. The exact organization of the registers and coils depends on the specific implementation, but there are some general guidelines that are commonly followed.

In most cases, the first few registers are reserved for system-level information, such as the device's ID, the firmware version, or the status of various internal components.

The remaining registers are typically organized into groups, each of which corresponds to a specific type of data. For example, there might be a group of registers for temperature data, a group for pressure data, and a group for flow data. The exact organization of the data within each group depends on the specific device and its capabilities.

Coils are typically organized into blocks, with each block containing a certain number of coils. The size of the block and the number of blocks available on the device depends on the specific implementation.

Overall, the organization of memory in Modbus is fairly flexible and can be adapted to fit the needs of different devices and applications. The key is to use a consistent, well-defined structure that allows the master device to access the data in a predictable manner.


# Data formats

* Binary: In the binary data format, the data is represented as a series of ones and zeros. This is the most efficient format for Modbus messages, because it requires the least amount of space to represent the data. However, it can be difficult for humans to read and understand binary data, so it is not commonly used for diagnostic or debugging purposes.
* Integer: In the integer data format, the data is represented as a 16-bit or 32-bit signed or unsigned integer. This format is commonly used for numeric values, such as temperatures, pressures, or other types of measured data.
* Floating-point: In the floating-point data format, the data is represented as a 32-bit or 64-bit floating-point value. This format is commonly used for values that require a higher level of precision, such as physical quantities that are measured with a high degree of accuracy.
* ASCII: In the ASCII data format, the data is represented as a series of ASCII characters. This format is easier for humans to read and understand, but it requires more space to represent the data than the binary or integer formats. It is commonly used for diagnostic or debugging purposes, but it is not as efficient for high-speed communication.



# Master - slave communication

In the Modbus protocol, the master device communicates with the slave devices using a request-response model. This means that the master device sends requests to the slave devices, and the slave devices respond with the requested information. The exact details of how the communication works depend on the specific implementation, but here are the basic steps that are involved:

1. The master device sends a request to a specific slave device, using the slave device's address and a function code that specifies the type of request. The request may contain data, such as a command or a value to be written to a register.
2. The slave device receives the request and processes it. If the request is a read request, the slave device retrieves the requested data from its internal memory. If the request is a write request, the slave device stores the data in the specified register or coil.
3. The slave device sends a response to the master device, which includes the requested data or a status code indicating the success or failure of the request. The response also includes the slave device's address and the same function code as the request.
4. The master device receives the response and processes it. If the response contains data, the master device can use the data to update its internal state or to control the operation of the slave device. If the response contains an error code, the master device can take appropriate action, such as retrying the request or displaying an error message.

This is a simplified description of how the master and slave devices communicate in Modbus, but it covers the basic principles of the protocol.

# Function codes

In the Modbus protocol, function codes are used to specify the type of request or response that is being sent between the master and slave devices. Each function code corresponds to a specific operation, such as reading a register, writing to a coil, or reading the device's status. The use of function codes allows the master and slave devices to exchange information in a standardized, predictable manner.

There are many different function codes available in the Modbus protocol, and the exact set of function codes supported by a given device depends on its capabilities and the specific implementation. Some of the most commonly-used function codes include:

0x01: Read Coils: This function code is used to read the values of one or more coils from a slave device. The request specifies the starting address and the number of coils to be read, and the response contains the values of the coils.

0x02: Read Discrete Inputs: This function code is used to read the values of one or more discrete inputs from a slave device. The request specifies the starting address and the number of inputs to be read, and the response contains the values of the inputs.

0x03: Read Holding Registers: This function code is used to read the values of one or more holding registers from a slave device. The request specifies the starting address and the number of registers to be read, and the response contains the values of the registers.

0x04: Read Input Registers: This function code is used to read the values of one or more input registers from a slave device. The request specifies the starting address and the number of registers to be read, and the response contains the values of the registers.

0x05: Write Single Coil: This function code is used to write a value to a single coil on a slave device. The request specifies the address of the coil and the value to be written, and the response contains the new value of the coil.

0x06: Write Single Register: This function code is used to write a value to a single 16-bit register on a slave device. The request specifies the address of

In Modbus RTU, the request message would typically include the slave address, the function code, the register address, and the value to be written, while the response message would usually include the slave address and the function code to confirm that the write operation was successful.

Discrete inputs are binary inputs that are typically used to read the state of digital input devices, such as switches or sensors. These inputs can be read by a Modbus master device using function code 2 (Read Discrete Inputs). 

Input registers are 16-bit registers that are typically used to read the values of analog input devices, such as sensors or meters.

Holding registers are 16-bit registers that are typically used to store values that can be read or written by a Modbus master device. These holding registers can be read using function code 3 (Read Holding Registers) or written using function code 6 (Write Single Register). The specific format and content of the request and response messages that are used for these functions depend on the specific Modbus variant that is being used. For example, in Modbus RTU, the request message for reading holding registers would typically include the slave address, the function code, and the starting address of the holding registers to be read, while the response message would include the slave address, the function code, and a series of 16-bit values that represent the contents of the holding registers. The request message for writing a single holding register would typically include the slave address, the function code, the register address, and the value to be written, while the response message would usually include the slave address and the function code to confirm that the write operation was successful.


# Error codes

error messages are special messages that are sent by a slave device to indicate that there was an error while processing a request from a master device. These error messages typically include the slave address, the function code of the original request, and an error code that indicates the specific type of error that occurred. Some common Modbus error codes include:

1: Illegal Function: This error code indicates that the slave device does not recognize the function code that was used in the request.
2: Illegal Data Address: This error code indicates that the data address that was specified in the request is not valid or is not available on the slave device.
3: Illegal Data Value: This error code indicates that the data value that was specified in the request is not valid or is not allowed for the given function code and data address.
4: Slave Device Failure: This error code indicates that the slave device was unable to process the request due to a hardware or software failure.
If a Modbus master device receives an error message from a slave device, it should take appropriate action based on the specific error code that was received. For example, if the error code indicates that the slave device does not recognize the function code that was used in the request, the master device may need to use a different function code or communicate with a different slave device.


# Memory map


In Modbus, the memory map is a logical organization of the data that is available on a slave device. This memory map defines the different types of data that can be accessed by a Modbus master device, as well as the specific addresses and data formats that are used for each type of data. The specific details of the memory map can vary depending on the specific Modbus variant that is being used and the capabilities of the slave device.

For example, in Modbus RTU, the memory map typically includes discrete inputs, input registers, holding registers, and coil outputs. The discrete inputs are binary inputs that are used to read the state of digital input devices, such as switches or sensors. The input registers are 16-bit registers that are used to read the values of analog input devices, such as sensors or meters. The holding registers are 16-bit registers that are used to store values that can be read or written by the Modbus master device. The coil outputs are binary outputs that are used to control digital output devices, such as relays or actuators.

Each of these data types is assigned a specific range of addresses in the memory map, and the Modbus master device uses these addresses to access the data on the slave device. For example, if a Modbus master device wants to read the value of an input register at address 100, it would send a request message with the slave address, the function code for reading input registers (4), and the starting address (100). The slave device would then respond with a message that includes the slave address, the function code, and the value of the input register at that address.



# Cables
The Modbus protocol uses a variety of different cables, depending on the specific application and the type of network. The most common type of cable used for Modbus communications is RS-485, which is a twisted pair cable that is used for serial communications. Other types of cables that may be used for Modbus include RS-232, Ethernet, and fiber optic cables. It is important to use the correct type of cable for your Modbus network in order to ensure reliable and efficient communication.
