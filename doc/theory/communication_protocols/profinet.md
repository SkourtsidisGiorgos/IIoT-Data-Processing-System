PROFINET (Process Field NETwork) is an industrial communication protocol used in automation technology. It is based on the Ethernet standard and is designed for use in manufacturing and process automation applications. PROFINET is a widely used protocol, with over 100 million devices installed worldwide. It is known for its high performance, reliability, and ease of use. PROFINET is an open standard, meaning that it is freely available for anyone to use. It is managed by the PROFIBUS Nutzerorganisation e.V. (PNO), a non-profit organization that promotes the use of PROFINET and other PROFIBUS technologies.


PROFINET uses a client-server architecture, in which devices on the network are either clients or servers. Clients are devices that initiate communication with servers, while servers are devices that provide information or services to clients. Each device on the network has a unique identifier, and communication between devices is based on this identifier.

PROFINET uses a star topology, in which all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. This allows for easy expansion of the network, as new devices can be added simply by connecting them to the central hub.

PROFINET is known for its high performance, reliability, and ease of use. It is widely used in a variety of applications, including manufacturing, process automation, and building automation.
