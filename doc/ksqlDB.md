# Average

ksqlDB is a tool for creating and running SQL-like queries on streaming data. To calculate the average for a time window, you can use the `AVG` aggregate function in a `GROUP BY` clause, specifying the time window as the `GROUP BY` key.

Here is an example of how this might look in a ksqlDB query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(value) FROM my_stream
GROUP BY HOP(time, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE, INTERVAL '5' MINUTE)
```

This query calculates the average value from the my_stream stream, grouping the data by a sliding time window of 5 minutes that advances by 1 minute. This means that the query will compute the average for the time periods `[00:00, 00:05), [00:01, 00:06), [00:02, 00:07)`, and so on.

It is also possible to specify a fixed time window, rather than a sliding window, by using the TUMBLE function instead of HOP. For example:

```sql
SELECT AVG(value) FROM my_stream
GROUP BY TUMBLE(time, INTERVAL '5' MINUTE)
```
This query calculates the average `value` for fixed 5-minute time periods, starting at the beginning of each hour (e.g. `[00:00, 00:05), [00:05, 00:10), [00:10, 00:15)`, and so on).


# Java integration

To run ksqlDB queries using Java, you can use the ksql-client library, which provides a Java API for interacting with a ksqlDB server. This library allows you to run ksqlDB queries and receive the results in your Java code.

To use the ksql-client library, you will first need to add it as a dependency to your Java project. This can typically be done by adding the following dependency to your project's pom.xml file (if you are using Maven) or build.gradle file (if you are using Gradle):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.confluent</groupId>
  <artifactId>ksql-client</artifactId>
  <version>5.5.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Once you have added the ksql-client library as a dependency, you can use it in your Java code to run ksqlDB queries. Here is an example of how this might look:

```java
// Create a KsqlClient object using the ksql-client library
KsqlClient ksqlClient = KsqlClient.create("http://localhost:8088");

// Run a ksqlDB query and retrieve the results as a KsqlResponse object
KsqlResponse response = ksqlClient.makeKsqlRequest("SELECT * FROM my_stream;");

// Print the results of the query
response.getResult().getRows().forEach(row -> System.out.println(row.getString("column_name")));
```
In this example, we create a KsqlClient object using the KsqlClient.create() method, specifying the URL of the ksqlDB server that we want to connect to. Then, we use the `makeK
