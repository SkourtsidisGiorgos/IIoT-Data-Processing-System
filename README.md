# Distributed Processing System for Industrial Protocols

Description:

This repository contains the source code of the diploma thesis titled 'Distributed Processing System for Industrial Protocols' developed at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). The project implements a robust, scalable, and real-time data processing system designed to handle and process multi-source and heterogeneous data originating from various industrial protocols.

The system provides features like fault tolerance, real-time data processing, scalability, performance monitoring, and a timely alert system for potential issues. Additionally, it can automatically trigger actions based on incoming data to prevent potential industrial accidents.  

**Project Components:**

- Data Simulation: Temperature, pressure, and power sensors' data is simulated using Python.
- Data Transfer: The Modbus protocol and the PLC4X library are utilized for transferring the sensor data to the Kafka system.
- Data Processing: Kafka Streams are employed for real-time data processing.
- Data Storage: Processed data is stored in an InfluxDB database, while the most recent data values are stored in-memory using the Redis system.
- Application: The entire application is implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework.
- Data Visualization: Data visualization is achieved via Grafana.
- Performance Monitoring: Performance metrics are monitored using Prometheus, cAdvisor, and Node Exporter.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of an end-to-end solution for industrial data processing systems. It provides a solid foundation for further development and improvements in the realm of real-time data processing and management systems in industrial settings.

- User Interface for managing the app and getting extra info
- Real-time data visualization using Grafana, InfluxDB and custom javascript with websockets protocol
- Use docker-compose to run the app

## Extra info
This is a demo app for a thesis. It is not meant to be used in production as is, needs further development and testing.  
All the components are running in docker containers. Data are simulated using python scripts. Currently, the app is configured to run in a single node, but it can be easily configured to run in a cluster.
For communication between the app and the sensors, the Modbus protocol is used. The PLC4X library is used for communication, so we can easily add more protocols in the future or replace Modbus protocol with another one.

## Pre-requisites

- Docker 20.0.0 or higher
- Docker-compose 2.0.0 or higher

## How to run

- Go to project's parent folder. Then:
- `mvn clean install` (first time only)
- `docker-compose up -d`
or 
- `COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose up -d` (uses caching for the builds)

The first time you run the app, it will take some time to download the images and build the containers.

To rebuild the containers, use `docker-compose build --no-cache streaming_iot` or `docker-compose up -d --build`  
To stop the app, use `docker-compose down` or `docker-compose down -v` to remove volumes as well (e.g. kafka data or influxdb data)

## How to use 

After that, the app will start and you can visit the following urls (all are links in localhost):
- [Swagger UI](http://localhost:10000/streaming-iot/swagger-ui/index.html). Use the endpoints to send data to the app.
- [App UI](http://localhost:10000/streaming-iot/overview). Navigate to multiple pages to see the functionality. Use the side menu to navigate.
- [Grafana](http://localhost:3000) (username: admin, password: admin). Got to `Dashboards -> Manage` to see the available dashboards.
- [Prometheus](http://localhost:9090). Explore the available metrics.
- [Kafka Control Center](http://localhost:9021)
- [Spring Boot Admin](http://localhost:10000)
- [InfluxDB](http://localhost:8086). Use `admin` as username and `mySecurePassword` as password. Load the `./doc/influx_db_dashboard_export/ntua_streaming_iot_measurements.json` file to see real time ingested data in a dashboard.

### Topic organization

Topic per measurement type. This is just an example. The exact number of topics and partitions can be configured in `application.yml` file.  
Each sensor has a unique id. The id is used as a key for the message. The key is used to partition the messages.   
This way, all messages from the same sensor will be stored in the same partition. This is useful for aggregations.  
```bash
  temperature(0)   |   power(1)   |   pressure(2)
  -----------------|--------------|---------------
   0  |  1  |  2   |    0  |  1   |  0  |  1  |  2
  -----------------|--------------|---------------
  27.1| 155.4| 90.3|    638|  722 | 22.1| 12.8| 21.5
  27.3| 157.9| 89.6|    652|  713 | 21.9| 12.6| 21.8
  27.2| 156.2| 89.9|    640|  720 | 22.0| 12.7| 21.7
  27.1| 155.4| 90.3|    638|  722 | 22.1| 12.8| 21.5
